      <p>
        When it comes to heating water in Indian homes, solar water heaters and electric geysers are two popular options. Letâ€™s compare them.
      </p>

      <h2>Solar Water Heaters</h2>
      <p>
        Solar water heaters use sunlight to heat water, reducing electricity consumption and bills significantly.
      </p>

      <h2>Advantages of Solar Water Heaters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Eco-friendly and renewable</li>
        <li>Lower operating costs</li>
        <li>Long-term savings</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Electric Geysers</h2>
      <p>
        Electric geysers heat water using electricity instantly but result in higher monthly power consumption.
      </p>

      <h2>When to Choose Which?</h2>
      <p>
        Solar water heaters are ideal in sunny regions and where hot water demand is consistent, while electric geysers work well in areas with less sunlight or intermittent use.
