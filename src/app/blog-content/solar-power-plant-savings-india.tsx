        Investing in a solar power plant in India offers significant savings on electricity bills and contributes to a greener environment.
      </p>

      <h2>Initial Investment and Payback Period</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Monthly Savings</h2>
      <p>
        Solar power plants generate electricity during the day, directly offsetting grid consumption and lowering monthly utility bills.

      <h2>Long-Term Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Energy independence</li>
        <li>Increased property value</li>
        <li>Environmental impact reduction</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maintenance Costs</h2>
      <p>
        Solar plants require minimal maintenance, mostly periodic cleaning and inverter servicing, keeping operating costs low.
