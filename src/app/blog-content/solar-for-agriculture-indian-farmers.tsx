      <p>
        Solar energy is transforming Indian agriculture by powering irrigation pumps and reducing farmers' reliance on diesel or grid electricity.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits of Solar Pumps for Farmers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced fuel and electricity costs</li>
        <li>Reliable and sustainable water supply</li>
        <li>Government subsidies and incentives available</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Solar Pumps</h2>
      <p>
        Both submersible and surface solar pumps are available, tailored to different farming needs and water table depths.
      </p>

      <h2>Implementation Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Initial cost and maintenance can be concerns, but government schemes aim to address these through financial aid and training.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
      <p>
        Increasing solar adoption in agriculture will boost productivity, reduce carbon emissions, and improve farmers' livelihoods across India.
