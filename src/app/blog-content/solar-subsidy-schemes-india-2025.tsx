        The Indian government offers several subsidy schemes to promote solar adoption in 2025. These schemes make solar energy affordable and accessible for households and businesses.
      </p>

      <h2>Residential Solar Subsidies</h2>
      <p>
        Subsidies for rooftop solar installations help homeowners reduce upfront costs by up to 40% in many states under schemes like the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) programs.
      </p>

      <h2>Commercial and Industrial Subsidies</h2>
      <p>
        Industries can benefit from capital subsidies and tax incentives that lower the cost of setting up large-scale solar power plants.
      </p>

      <h2>State-Level Initiatives</h2>
      <p>
        States like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra provide additional subsidies and net metering benefits to encourage solar uptake.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Apply?</h2>
      <p>
        Contact authorized solar installers who can guide you through the subsidy application process or visit the official MNRE website for detailed information.
